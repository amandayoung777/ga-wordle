General Assembly Wordle Project

I am a student currently doing a software engineering immersive course at General Assembly and our assignment was to make a game based off the Wordle game.

Wordle is a word guesing game which allows users 6 turns in which to guess a 5 letter word (which has been previously selected).

If the guessed letter is in the correct spot, the corresponding box turns green.

If the guessed letter is in the correct word, but is not guessed in the correct spot, the corresponding box turns yellow.

If the guessed letter is incorrect, the box will turn red.

The game ends after the word is correctly guessed, or if the word is not correctly guessed after 6 tries. 

gameOver function is adapted from MDN.
